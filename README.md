# piano_accuracy_scoring
Reports what percent of incorrect notes were hit in a session based on a correct example

Right now if you cd to src, you should be able to record some sound and have it printed out in a graphic.

Almost none of this is my code, I just combined two different softwares into one.

I'm hoping to soon have it be able to detect differences in midi events as one repeats a section of one-handed piano (I'm currently learning this piece by bach):

Hopefully this is useful to others.
